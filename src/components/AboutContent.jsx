                 I currently have a bachelor's degree in information systems. <br/> 
                Application development whether on the web or desktop is<br/> 
                one of my greatest passions.<br/> 
                <br/> 
                One of my characteristics about learning is that I am self-taught, <br/> 
                so even before university I was already learning and practicing <br/> 
                applications development. <br/> 
                <br/> 
                During and after university, I learned new programming languages, <br/>  
                concepts and technologies in the field of information systems <br/> 
                that contributed a lot to improve my skills and experience. <br/> 
                <br/> 
                I look for new challenges that further leverage more my knowledge, <br/> 
                skills and experience.
